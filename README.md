# Elliptic Curves and Cryptography

This project explores the mathematical structure of elliptic curves and their application in cryptography. It covers the definition, geometric interpretation, and group structure of elliptic curves. The paper then focuses on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is essential to the security of elliptic curve cryptographic systems.

The project also includes an overview of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol and an analysis of Pollard’s Rho Algorithm, a well-known method used to attack the ECDLP.

The repository includes the following files:
  elliptic_curves.pdf: The full project report.
  elliptic_curves.tex: LaTeX source code for the report.
  elliptic_curves.py: Python implementation of elliptic curve operations and Pollard’s Rho Algorithm.
